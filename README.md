# image_compression_decompression
Algorithm compresses image by taking diagonal averages of pixels and storing every four pixels in one pixel which reduces size significantly. Most images tested don't lose more than 2%. Decompression algorithm implemented too. Have fun trying it with the display in a ssh -X. Make sure you install X-quartz :)
